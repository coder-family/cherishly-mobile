# Invitation Expiration Removal

## Overview

We have removed the expiration logic from family group invitations to improve user experience. This change makes the invitation system more user-friendly, similar to Facebook friend requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components

#### `MyInvitationsSection.tsx`

- Removed `disabled={invitation.isExpired}` from Accept button
- Removed expired status display
- Changed "Expires:" to "Sent:" to show when invitation was sent
- All invitations can now be accepted or declined at any time

#### `PendingInvitationsModal.tsx`

- Removed `isExpired()` function
- Removed expired styling and logic
- All invitations can now be resent or cancelled
- Removed conditional rendering for expired invitations

### 2. Redux State

#### `familySlice.ts`

- Removed `isExpired: boolean` from `myInvitations` interface
- Simplified invitation state management

#### `familyService.ts`

- Removed `isExpired` field from `getMyPendingInvitations` response interface

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can accept invitations at their convenience
2. **No Time Pressure**: No rush to respond to invitations
3. **Consistent with Social Media**: Similar to Facebook friend requests
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No more expired invitation states to manage

## Backend Considerations

The backend should also be updated to:

1. Remove expiration logic from invitation creation
2. Remove expiration checks from invitation acceptance/decline endpoints
3. Keep invitations active until explicitly accepted or declined

## Migration Notes

- Existing expired invitations will still work if the backend allows it
- New invitations will not have expiration dates
- Users can now accept old invitations that were previously marked as expired
